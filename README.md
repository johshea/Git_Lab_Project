# Advanced GitHub Lab Guide

Welcome to the **Advanced GitHub Lab**! This guide builds on beginner concepts and teaches:

- Conflict resolution
- Interactive rebase
- Using GitHub Desktop
- Using GitHub with VS Code

---

##  Lab 1: Git Rebase
git rebase is a powerful Git command that lets you move or "replay" commits from one branch onto another. 
It's used to create a clean, linear commit history by integrating changes from one branch into another 
without creating a merge commit.

### Step 1: Create Two Branches
```bash
git checkout -b base-feature
echo "Base Feature" > base.txt
git add base.txt
git commit -m "Add base feature"
git checkout main
```

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
echo "New Feature" > new.txt
git add new.txt
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

### Step 2: Rebase onto Main
```bash
git checkout new-feature
git rebase main
```

---

##  Lab 2: Conflict Resolution

### Simulate Conflict:
1. Edit the same line in `conflict.txt` in both `main` and `conflict-branch`.

```bash
# On main
echo "Hello from main" > conflict.txt
git commit -am "Main edit"

# On branch
git checkout -b conflict-branch
echo "Hello from branch" > conflict.txt
git commit -am "Branch edit"
```

2. Try to merge:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge conflict-branch
```

3. Resolve conflict manually in `conflict.txt`, then:
```bash
git add conflict.txt
git commit
```

---

##  Lab 3: GitHub Desktop

1. Download: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Clone a repo using File -> Clone repository
3. Make changes, commit via UI
4. Push changes and create PR from Desktop

---

##  Lab 4: VS Code Integration

### Step 1: Install GitHub Extension
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions -> Install "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"

### Step 2: Clone & Work
1. Clone from VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> Git: Clone)
2. Make changes -> Source Control panel -> Commit
3. Push & sync with GitHub

##  Summary

You've learned:

- How to rebase branches
- How to resolve merge conflicts
- How to use GitHub Desktop and VS Code for Git

Practice and integrate these into your real projects!

2. Go to **VCS > Get from Version Control**
3. Paste your GitHub repository URL and click **Clone**

### Step 2: Make Changes and Commit

1. Open any file or create a new one
2. Make changes
3. Go to **VCS > Commit** or click the **Commit** button at the bottom

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

1. After committing, click **Push** or go to **VCS > Git > Push**
2. The changes will be sent to GitHub

## ðŸ§ª Lab 6: GitHub Actions Basics

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool built into GitHub.

### Step 1: Create a Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with this content:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Run a script
      run: echo "âœ… Build completed!"
```

### Step 2: Push Changes

Push this to GitHub and check the **Actions** tab for workflow runs.
